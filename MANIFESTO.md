# Bayes Babies: A Manifesto

"Geometric ergodicity is usually the necessary condition for MCMC estimators to follow a central limit theorem". Everyday we rack our brains around expressions such as this. At talks, in papers, blog posts and even (so called) tutorials. Simple concepts often hide behind complex jargon and formulae perpetuated by intellectual elitism, conservatism and self-preservation. And we're tired. Tired of failing to fully engage with presentations. Tired of spending hours trying to make sense of a paper. Tired of missing out on the many promised benefits of the holy grail of data science and machine learning: _Bayesian Statistics_.

__A superficial understanding of Bayesian statistics is no longer an option.__

We therefore commit to developing a deeper and lasting understanding of _Bayesian Statistics_. We begin this journey as total, complete beginners. We might not be individually the brightest nor the most talented, but together we work towards mastering the Bayesian paradigm from the ground up, the hard way, without shortcuts. Through shared knowledge, whether that is selected references, code examples or short eurekas; the babies will become toddlers and grow to become self-sufficient young adults.

A few work principles will have to be agreed upon. The motto is "show rather than tell". This means that our get togethers will not be the typical one speaker to many listeners _ad nauseam_, but rather interactive sessions where we discuss our understanding, or lack thereof, of a subject and share our attempts at tackling a specific problem. Although "experts" or advanced users may be invited to offer input or shed light on said problem/subject, it is first and foremost our own responsibility to go through the many tribulations and iterations of the learning process. Error shall not be cause for despair, as it is as fundamental to learning as is correctness. With explicit and, if necessary, exhaustive reasoning, founded on precise and simple terminology, we shall combat cheap obfuscation tactics and unnecessarily complex lingo. This way together, my fellow babies, we shall find a path out of the rabbit hole and conquer the Hydra that is Bayesian Statistics.
